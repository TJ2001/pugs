    <h2>Temperment</h2>
    <p>The breed is often described as multum in parvo, or "much in little", alluding to the Pug's remarkable personality, despite its small size.[1] Pugs are strong willed but rarely aggressive, and are suitable for families with children. The majority of the breed is very fond of children and sturdy enough to properly play with them. Depending on their owner's mood, they can be quiet and docile but also vivacious and teasing.[8] Pugs tend to be intuitive and sensitive to the moods of their owners and are usually eager to please them.[3] Pugs tend to have a somewhat lazy nature and spend a lot of time napping. They are often called "shadows" because they follow their owners around and like to stay close to the action,[9] craving attention and affection from their owners.[10][11]</p>
